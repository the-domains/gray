**Why:** Gray is on a mission to love Existence (in all of its incarnations) with such wild abandon that she inspires in you the courage and enthusiasm to do the same. You on board?

**Who: **A writer and performer for nearly 2 decades, Gray draws on her eclectic background of improv, theater, dance, gymnastics, linguistics, Zen Buddhism and Corporate America to rub a metaphorical nose -- through story and performance --  in the juicy, blurry spaces between I, me, you, Who? Mu.

**What: **Her fast-paced solo show,_BURST_ opened in 2009 and has since been performed in New York, San Francisco, Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Phoenix and part of the Women at Work festival. As the keynote speaker, Gray performed_BURST_at the 2010 New Mexico Consumer Wellness Conference in Albuquerque, NM. Her second solo show_Self-ish_, was presented at the 2011 Santa Fe Solo Performance Fest and The Garage in San Francisco May  2012\.

**Where: **Gray does both on-stage and off-stage improv performances with central themes of identity, vulnerability, transparency... and believes in creative enlightenment through first-hand trial-and-error. She is a regular featured performer at[Action Fiction!][1] SF, and has performed with  [Mortified][0]! San Francisco, Berkeley and New York, with other appearances at Foundry Nights in Berkeley. She also appeared in "Joy of Lex," a documentary on language for The Discovery Channel.

**How:** She has training in Action Theater(tm) with founder Ruth Zapora and teacher [Owen Walker][2], improv with [Pan Theater][3], and at [ACT San Francisco][4]--as well as writing with [Natalie Goldberg][5], the late California poet laureate David Bromig..
